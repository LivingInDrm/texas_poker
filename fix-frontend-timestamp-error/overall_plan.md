# Overall Bug Fix Plan

## Goal
Fix the frontend white screen issue caused by `action.timestamp.getTime is not a function` error in GamePage.tsx:158

## Problem Analysis
- **Error Location**: GamePage.tsx line 158, inside a map function at line 154
- **Root Cause**: Frontend expects `action.timestamp` to be a Date object but receives a string/number
- **Impact**: Game page crashes with white screen when trying to render game actions

## Affected Modules
- `frontend/src/pages/GamePage.tsx` - Where the error occurs
- Backend game handlers - Where timestamps are created and sent
- `frontend/src/types/game.ts` - Type definitions for actions
- Socket communication layer - Data serialization/deserialization

## High-Level Actions
- Identify where timestamps are created in backend vs frontend expectations
- Fix timestamp serialization/deserialization in Socket.IO communication
- Add proper type conversion in frontend when receiving action data
- Ensure all timestamp fields are consistently handled as Date objects in frontend
