# Claude Coding Prompt Guide: Explore -> Plan -> Code -> Commit

Use this workflow to get the most reliable and thoughtful results when solving programming tasks.

---

## Step 1: Explore

You must read the relevant files, images, or URLs first.

You may be told to read specific files (e.g. `logging.py`) or broader areas (e.g. "the file that handles logging").

**Do not write any code yet.**  
Your only task is to gather context and understand the problem space.

---

## Step 2: Plan

You must now think about how to approach the problem.

To activate deep thinking, use commands like:
- `think`
- `think hard`
- `think harder`
- `ultrathink`

Each phrase gives you progressively more internal reasoning time.

**Do not write any code yet.**  
Your goal is to come up with a clear plan of action.

---

## Step 3: Code

Begin implementing your solution based on your prior plan.

You must:
- Write clean, clear code.
- Pause during key steps to verify the logic.
- Explain design tradeoffs if any.

---

## Step 4: Commit

You must prepare your changes for submission.

Tasks include:
- Committing the code
- Creating a pull request (PR)
- Updating relevant documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, etc.)
- Writing a clear summary of what changed and why


---

## Final Notes

- **Always perform Step 1 and Step 2** unless explicitly told to skip them.
- Skipping Explore or Plan increases the risk of incomplete or misaligned solutions.
- This workflow ensures you write code only after proper understanding and reasoning.
